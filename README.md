# Learning C#

This is a little learning program for myself to explore lots of different functions of C#.  
I wrote this using Visual Studio and following w3schools C# tutorial.  

I use it as a cheat sheet for C# - having learnt Python, Ruby and JavaScript before this helps me pointing out the differences.
